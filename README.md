# 🛍️ Shopify Multi-Market Setup

This project showcases my experience customizing a Shopify store for multiple geographic markets (Australia and New Zealand).

## 🌍 Project Scope

The client's Shopify store needed separate product visibility and navigation for AU and NZ customers. I worked on:

- Implementing **Shopify Markets** for regional targeting
- Setting up **market-specific collections**
- Adjusting navigation using **Shopify Liquid** logic
- Hiding products not available in certain countries
- Managing **domain-based redirection**
- Resolving broken links, empty tiles, and visibility conflicts

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- `Shopify`
- `Liquid`
- `Shopify Markets`
- `Navigation Menus`
- `Collections`
- `Theme Customization`

## 📍 Client Location
Australia & New Zealand

## 📌 Result

✅ The final solution displayed the correct products per market, removed irrelevant navigation items, and ensured a clean, regional user experience — all without disrupting the global store structure.
